# Food-Service-Industry-Model
This project models the economic interactions between members of the food industry:

- various foodplaces: restaurants, fast food stores and foodstands.
- people related to the foodplaces: owners, working owners, staff, cooks and servers.
- payment in this food economy: customers, checks, tips, taxes and tax collectors.

This project only models one year of this complex economy where the taxes get collected at the end of the year.
